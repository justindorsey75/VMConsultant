# About the author
Justin Dorsey is a Vulnerability Management professional with over 10+ years of experience. Below is a sample report of vulnerbiltiies that have been packaged into a prioritized report to demostrate the level of insights that I have provided during my tenure as a VM consultant/analyst. Please note the vulnerability data here is from virtual machines that are no longer up and no enterprise data has been exposed in any of the sample work here.

## Problem Statement
In the current era organizations are continually at risk of breaches that could result in millions of dollars in damages due to our heavy reliance of information technology systems. However remediating vulnerabilities is a daunting task for most organizations and prioritization and direction is needed to make meaning progress in improving organizations resilince to cyber attacks. The example here will walkthrough a fictitious customer who is standing up their security program from the ground up and has invested in a team to establish their vulnerability management program.

## The Customer
Our customer in this is example is a small upstart finance company. As a finance company leadership is anticipating needing to be ready to pass PCI audits of their company. As it currently stands, the company does not have a formal vulnerability management program and needs to get its program stood up. We have been hired by the company to accomplish the aforementioned mission of setting up the vulnerability management program. Upon initial review we have determined that we need to get our SSP, SOP, and runbook written to outline our processes and technologies that our program will use to execute vulnerability scanning and reporting. These documents will also be the measuring stick that we provide to our auditors that we will be assessed against.

## Vulnerability Analysis
